# Report on the Dashboard for Bank Customer Churn Prediction
# Dataset Name: Bank Customer Churn Prediction
# Data Source: Kaggle
# Introduction
This report analyzes the Bank Customer Churn dataset using a MongoDB Atlas dashboard. The dataset contains customer information such as demographics, product usage, tenure, and credit score. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), the dashboard answers key business questions related to customer behavior, churn rates, and engagement metrics. The insights derived aim to assist decision-makers in improving retention strategies and tailoring services to customer needs.
# Key Questions Addressed and Insights
# 1. What is the geographical distribution of customers?
Visualization: Distribution by Country (Map View)
Insight:
The majority of customers are concentrated in specific geographic regions, with France, Germany, and Spain being prominent. Such insights help in targeting marketing efforts and allocating resources where the customer base is stronger.
# 2. How does product engagement vary across customers?
Visualization: Product Engagement vs. Balance
Insight:
Most customers engage with one or two products. Engagement drops significantly with higher product counts (three or more). This suggests that while customers are open to cross-selling, offering too many products might overwhelm them.
# 3. What is the demographic segmentation of customers?
Visualization: Customer Segmentation by Age and Gender
Insight:
The age group 30-40 dominates the customer base, with a fairly equal gender distribution. However, slight variations exist across different age groups. This helps in tailoring campaigns to the preferences of a specific demographic.
# 4. How active are the customers?
Visualization: Active Members vs. Total Members
Insight:
A large proportion of customers are active, reflecting decent engagement. However, a closer look reveals a subset of inactive members, which can be a focus for reactivation campaigns.
# 5. How does churn vary with customer tenure?
Visualization: Churn Rate Across Tenure
Insight:
Churn rates are higher among customers with shorter tenure (1-5 years). Efforts to improve the onboarding process and build loyalty among new customers could help reduce churn in this segment.
# 6. What is the relationship between active membership and churn?
Visualization: Active Members vs. Churn (Donut Chart)
Insight:
Active members are less likely to churn compared to inactive ones. This reinforces the importance of keeping customers engaged through personalized offers, loyalty programs, and regular interactions.
# 7. How does product usage differ by gender?
Visualization: Product Number vs. Gender
Insight:
Both males and females predominantly use one or two products, but females are slightly more likely to use a second product. Gender-specific product bundling could help increase engagement.
# 8. What is the correlation between churn and credit scores?
Visualization: Churn by Credit Score
Insight:
Customers with lower credit scores show higher churn rates. Providing financial counseling or tailored product offerings for this group may help mitigate risk and improve retention.
# 9. How does account balance vary with tenure?
Visualization: Balance Distribution vs. Tenure
Insight:
Customers with 10+ years of tenure tend to maintain higher balances, suggesting loyalty and financial stability. Special rewards or VIP programs could strengthen their long-term commitment.
# 10. How does churn rate relate to product usage and tenure?
Visualization: Churn Rate vs. Product Number
Insight:
Churn is more likely among customers using only one product and those with lower tenure. This indicates a need to cross-sell additional products early in the customer lifecycle.
